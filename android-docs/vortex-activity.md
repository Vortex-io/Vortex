# Vortex Activity

Vortex Structure Depends on The Single Activity and Depends on This Concept You can't write any logic at the Activity for This Reason You can just Declare The Activity Layout At The Activity Component

 

```text
class SplashScreen : VortexScreen() {
    override fun getLayoutRes(): Int {
        return R.layout.activity_main
    }
}
```
